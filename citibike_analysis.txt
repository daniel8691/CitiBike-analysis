Map:
The map of the city shows the locations of the CitiBike locations within the city as well as their popularities. The 
center of the city seems to be where most trips take place. 

Seasonality: 
Line plots were used to describe the seasonality of the bike usage rates in New York City. Two years of data, from 
2017 and 2018 respectively, were used to see the relationship between time of year and miles traveled. The graphs 
showed that bikes have higher mileages during warmer months (late Spring, Summer, early Fall) and the mileage falls
during colder months (late Fall, Winter, early Spring). This can be explained by snow accumulations on the road that 
raises the difficulty of riding a bike or that most travelers don't prefer to participate in outdoor activities in the cold
especially for the winter weather the city offers. There tend to be a small spike in mileage traveled mid December for
both years which can be explained by the holiday seasons that drive the demand for intracity travel. 

Top stations in New York City by usage rate
The most popular bike station in NYC is Pershing Sqaure which is located right in the heart of the city
beside the grand central transit station. This popularity could be supported by the large number of travelers 
arriving at the grand central station for business or leisure purposes. The city is not a great location for
vehicles due to traffic reasons so it could be right to assume that travelers prefer to arrive at the city by
train or buses and continue to reach their destinations through bike shares. 

Usage rates:
The bar charts show that younger demographics from 23 to 40 have higher biking activities than other age groups with the exception 
to people at 51 years of age which could be a calculation error in the dataset. The data is shown to be mildly inaccurate
because some bikers are over 110 years of age which seems unreasonable
